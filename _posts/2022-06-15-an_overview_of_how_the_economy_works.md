Macroeconomics is a difficult discipline. Like any other hypothesis, we want our model of the economy to be both expressive and simple. But in the case of macro, obtaining such a model is hard because the aggregate quantities that we observe in practice are determined by thousands and thousands of decisions made by complex economic agents. The economy itself is a complex system with sophisticated information processing capabilities and feedback loops. Questions like "Why did inflation increase this year?" certainly have exact precise answers, but they are probably so long that no one can comprehend them.

This post explores the simplest macroeconomic model, the IS-LM model, and lays the groundwork for future discussions around that topic. The IS-LM model is a purely conceptual model. It has no real predictive value and lacks any kind of dynamics. It is not concerned with technical issues like how fast equilibrium is reached or how much precisely does a given variable increase. Its main strength is its simplicity and the ability to capture fundamental relationships between macroeconomic aggregates. Most importantly, it provides precious intuition about how the economy works.

To begin, we distinguish between three economic entities - households, firms, and the government. Each citizen can be a member of one or more of these. The households consume, save, and invest. The firms employ labour and capital, produce goods and services, and invest. The government collects taxes and spends money (among many other things). These are the main players of the game.

In terms of economic aggregates, macro is concerned with three important variables: *output*, *unemployment*, and *inflation*. Output relates to how much is produced in a given year and measures how big the economy is. Unemployment relates to how easy it is to find a job, given that you want to work. In a capitalist society where you are paid only in exchange for the labour services that you provide, unemployment is an indicator of how well employees are matched with prospective employers. Finally, inflation relates to the general movements of the prices of goods and services. A representative price level is defined and tracked. Its up/down movements indicate that a fixed amount of money now buys you less/more goods than before.

When determining the relationships between output, unemployment, and inflation, it is useful to distinguish between three time frames:
- the *short-run*, when information from exogenous shocks has not propagated all economic agents yet, resulting in some variables remaining fixed;
- the *medium-run*, when sufficient time has passed that those previous constant variables can be adjusted, resulting in different equilibrium configurations;
- the *long-run*, a time horizon so long that all transitory economic effects from the medium run are dwarfed by time. Here only factors which determine long-term growth matter.

The distinction between short, medium, and long-run is naturally fuzzy. If we are at time $t$, we may consider $t+1$ as the short run and $t+30$ as the long-run. But if we are at $t+29$, then $t+30$, from our new perspective, becomes the short-run. This perspective change is similar to a Markov chain converging to an equilibrium distribution - it's not that it actually converges step-by-step, it's that the distribution many steps from now converges.

The concept of equilibrium permeates economics.



<!-- In principle, the macroeconomic aggregates 

Like any other hypothesis, we want our model of the economy to be both expressive and simple (so that it can be understood by people and estimated from limited historical data). I don't think I'll exagerate by saying that macroeconomics is the field where achieving a good compromise between these requirements is the most difficult.


On the one hand, modelling an entire economy requires coming up with a theoretical framework, usually a set of logical and intuitive relationships between the entities, for how the economy behaves. These should be simple, robust, and generalizable - they should capture fundamental human behaviour. On the other hand, the model has to be computable and accurate (in terms of real-world prediction).  -->

      <p>Current methods to learn controllers for autonomous vehicles (AVs) focus on behavioural cloning, where agents learn to mimic the actions obtained from an expert trajectory. Being trained only on exact historic data, the resulting agents often generalize poorly when deployed to novel scenarios. Simulators provide the opportunity to go beyond offline datasets, but they are still treated as complicated black boxes, only used to update the global simulation state. As a result, these RL algorithms are slow, sample-inefficient, and prior-agnostic. Instead, if these simulators are differentiable, they can be included into an end-to-end training loop, turning their hard-coded world dynamics into useful inductive biases for the model. Here we explore the differentiable Waymax simulator and use analytic policy gradients to train AV controllers on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) [1]. This allows us to learn robust, accurate, and fast policies only using gradient descent.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In <em>policy gradients</em> one optimizes the policy function directly by maximizing the likelihood of actions corresponding to high rewards. This results in stochastic optimization that is often difficult to optimize and that is over-reliant on the rewards, which for realistic settings like driving, may be prohibitively hard to define. <em>Model-based</em> methods learn the dynamics of the environment allowing them to <em>plan</em> at test-time. This results in training which is stable, but slow to execute. Additionally, the precision of the policy is bounded by the precision of the learned dynamics. Finally, imitation learning attempts to learn from expert actions which may be costly to obtain in large quantities or lack sufficient diversity.</p>
<p>In settings where the environment dynamics are known one would likely be able to harvest the best aspects from each of these methods. In fact, if the environment is differentiable, one can optimize the policy directly using gradient descent, just via supervision from expert agent trajectories. The benefits of this are: 1) Obtaining an <em>explicit policy for continuous control</em>, 2) <em>Fast inference</em>, since there is no planning at test time. 3) <em>Unbounded policy precision</em>, due to the dynamics not being approximated, 4) Facilitating more <em>grounded learning</em> by incorporating the dynamics directly into the training loop.</p>
<p>Waymax was recently introduced as a differentiable, large-scale autonomous driving simulator. In this work, we utilize its differentiability to train controllers using Analytic Policy Gradients (APG), reaping all the benefits mentioned above. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply this method on such a large-scale task, obtaining strong competitive performance comparable to larger heavily-engineered models.</p>
<h3>Method</h3>
<p>In essence, a differentiable environment allows us to backpropagate gradients through it and directly optimize the policy. The resulting method broadly falls into the <em>analytic policy gradients</em> (APG) type of algorithms. In our setting we assume we are given expert trajectories <span class="math">\( \{ \hat{\mathbf{s}}_t \}_{t=1}^T\)</span>, instead of rewards. The goal is to train the policy <span class="math">\(\pi_\theta\)</span> so that upon a roll-out, it reproduces the expert trajectory:
</p>
<div class="math">$$
\begin{equation} \label{eq:task_objective}
\min_\theta \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T  {\lVert \hat{\mathbf{s}}_t - {\mathbf{s}}_t \rVert}_2, \text{ where } {\textbf{s}}_t = \text{Env}\left( {\textbf{s}}_{t-1}, \mathbf{a}_{t-1} \right) \text{ and } \textbf{a}_{t-1} \sim \pi_\theta \left( \textbf{s}_{t-1} \right)
\end{equation}
$$</div>
<p>
Here, and in what follows, <span class="math">\(\hat{\textbf{s}}_t\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\hat{\textbf{a}}_t\)</span> refer to ground truth states and actions while <span class="math">\(\textbf{s}_t\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\textbf{a}_t\)</span> are the corresponding simulated states and actions. The sequence of states <span class="math">\( \{ \mathbf{s}_t \}_{t=1}^T\)</span> forms a trajectory.</p>
<p>This optimization task is difficult because trajectories are generated in a sequential manner with current states depending on previous actions, which themselves recursively depend on previous states. Additionally, <span class="math">\(\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}\)</span> (shown here only for only one of its additive terms) has the form
</p>
<div class="math">$$
\begin{equation} \label{eq: grad_form}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial {\mathbf{s}_t}}
\frac{\partial \mathbf{s}_t}{\partial {\mathbf{a}_{t-1}}}
\frac{\partial \mathbf{a}_{t-1}}{\partial {\mathbf{s}_{t-1}}}
\frac{\partial \mathbf{s}_{t-1}}{\partial {\mathbf{a}_{t-2}}}
\dots
\frac{\partial \mathbf{a}_0}{\partial \theta }
\end{equation}
$$</div>
<p>
which multiplicatively composes multiple derivatives <span class="math">\(\frac{\partial \mathbf{s}_t}{\partial \mathbf{a}_{t-1}}\)</span>, corresponding to the environment dynamics, and mixes them together with the policy derivatives <span class="math">\(\frac{\partial \mathbf{a}_t}{\partial \mathbf{s}_{t}}\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Application setting</strong>. Ultimately, for motion perception and planning in autonomous vehicles, we are interested in multi-modal trajectory prediction. Given a short history segment for all agents in the scene, we want to obtain <span class="math">\(K\)</span> <em>modes</em>, or possible trajectories, for the future of each agent. In the presence of a simulator we can learn a stochastic policy, or controller, for the agents. Then, we can perform <span class="math">\(K\)</span> roll-outs, obtaining <span class="math">\(K\)</span> future trajectories. Hence, in the presence of a simulator, the task of trajectory prediction reduces to learning a policy <span class="math">\(\pi_\theta: \textbf{s}_t \mapsto \textbf{a}_t\)</span> to control the agents.</p>
<p><strong>Obtaining gradients</strong>. We apply our APG method in the Waymax simulator [2]. Being implemented in Jax, it is relatively flexible in choosing which variable to differentiate and with respect to what. That being said, many of the <em>obtainable</em> derivatives are not meaningful. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>The derivatives of future agent locations with respect to the current traffic light state are all zero, because the agent locations and, in general, the simulator dynamics do not depend on the roadgraph or the traffic lights.
\item Derivatives of agent locations wrt. traffic light states or roadgraphs are all zero, because the simulator dynamics do not depend on the roadgraph or the traffic lights.</li>
<li>Certain metrics such as collision or offroad detection are boolean in nature. Other objects such as traffic lights have discrete states. These are problematic for differentiation.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is <em>meaningful</em> and <em>useful</em> is to take the gradients of future agent locations with respect to current actions. These are precisely the derivatives needed for the optimization above and hence we focus on them. To obtain them, one needs to ensure that the relevant structures in the code are registered in Jax's <code>pytree</code> registry, so that any tracing, just-in-time compilation, or functional transformations like <code>grad</code> can work on them.</p>
<p>Moreover, we found it useful to adapt the bicycle dynamics to be gradient-friendly. This includes adding a small epsilon to the argument of a square root to avoid the case when its input is 0, as well as adapting the yaw angle wrapping, present in many similar settings, to use <code>arctan2</code> instead of <code>mod</code>, which makes the corresponding derivatives continuous.</p>

    <figcaption> Figure 1: Learning with and without simulator. Left: learning by behaviour cloning where we replay the GT trajectory and supervise the predicted actions. Middle: APG where we roll-out and supervise the trajectories without detaching gradients (shown in colored arrows). Right: APG where we detach gradients from past timesteps. The slanted arrows from $\textbf{a}_t$ to $\textbf{s}_{t+1}$ are the environment dynamics. The detachment during simulation offers efficient and lightweight training.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>Dense trajectory supervision</strong>. Obtaining the gradients of the environment dynamics opens up technical questions of how to train in such a setup. One can supervise the rolled-out trajectory only at the final state and let the gradients flow all the way back to the initial state. Since this does not supervise <em>path</em> taken to the objective, in our experiments we densely supervise all states in the collected trajectory with all states in the GT trajectory.</p>
<p><strong>Gradient detaching</strong>. 
Dense supervision allows us to detach the gradients at the right places, as shown in the third part of Fig. 1. Here, when we obtain <span class="math">\(\mathbf{s}_t\)</span>, we calculate the loss and backpropagate through the environment dynamics obtaining <span class="math">\(\partial \mathbf{s}_t / \partial \mathbf{a}_{t - 1}\)</span> without continuing on to previous steps. This makes training slower, since gradients for the earlier steps do not accumulate, as in a RNN, but effectively cuts the whole trajectory into many <span class="math">\((\textbf{s}_t, \textbf{a}_t, \textbf{s}_{t+1})\)</span> transitions which can be treated independently by the optimization step. This allows <em>off-policy</em> training -- a key aspect of our setup.</p>
<figure>
    <img class='big_img' src="/images/apg_model.PNG" alt="APG model" width="1200">
    <figcaption> Figure 2: Unrolling the model in time with gradient detachment inside the differentiable simulator. Starting from the simulator state $\mathbf{s}_t$, we obtain an observation $\mathbf{o}_t$, containing the scene elements such as agents locations, traffic lights, and roadgraph, which gets encoded into features $\mathbf{x}_t$. An RNN (recurrent over time) with a policy head outputs actions $\mathbf{a}_t$ which are executed in the simulated environment to obtain the new state $\mathbf{s}_{t + 1}$. When applying a loss between $\mathbf{s}_{t + 1}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{t + 1}$ the gradients flow back through the environment and update the policy head, RNN, and the scene encoder. Similar to BPTT, gradients through the RNN hidden state accumulate. We do not backpropagate through the observation or the simulator state.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>Model overview</strong>.
We present our model setup in Figure 2. For training, we roll-out a full trajectory and supervise with the GT one. The gradients flow back through the differentiable dynamics, policy and scene encoder, and continue back to the previous scene contexts using a RNN hidden state. We detach the previous simulator state for both <em>necessity</em> and <em>flexibility</em> so that the state transitions on which we compute the loss can be different from the transitions executed during roll-out.</p>
<p><strong>Optimization difficulty</strong>. Differentiating through a stochastic policy requires that the actions be reparametrized. But every reparametrization leads to stochastic gradients for those layers before it. And when we compose multiple sampling operations sequentially, such as in the computation graph of the entire collected trajectory, the noise starts to compound and may overwhelm the actual signal from the trajectory steps, making the optimization more noisy and difficult. To address this, we implement <em>incremental</em> training where we periodically "reset" the simulated state back to the corresponding log state. This ensures that data-collection stays around the GT trajectory, instead of far from it. The frequency of resetting decays as training progresses.</p>
<p><strong>Agent processing</strong>. For multi-agent simulation it is useful to slightly adapt our architecture to allow training with <span class="math">\(N\)</span> agents but evaluating with <span class="math">\(M\)</span>. We adopt a small transformer that forces each agent to attend to the other ones in parallel. However, at the last transformer block we use a fixed number of learned queries which attend over the variable number of agent keys and values, effectively soft-clustering them, and becoming independent of their number. This allows us to train with 32 agents but evaluate with 128, as required for example by the Sim Agents challenge [3].</p>

    <figcaption> Figure 3: Sample trajectories. Row 1 shows BC, while row 2 and 3 show APG applied in the planning and multi-agent control. BC produces agents that swerve, while the APG trajectories are more realistic. Blue circles show controlled agents in the beginning of the trajectory. Red, green, and yellow circles represent traffic lights.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>Qualitative study</strong>. We showcase samples from our method in Fig. 3 and observe that in the planning setting APG realizes accurate stochastic trajectories. Errors occur mostly from not predicting the correct acceleration, not the steering, which is prevalent in the BC models and causes the agent there to swerve. The MA-APG trajectories are relatively less accurate because, unlike in planning, when all agents are controlled, any prediction will have an effect on any agent, making training more difficult. Nonetheless, performance is quite good, showing that the benefit of a differentiable simulator, which is the ability to train policies in a supervised manner, is indeed useful, leading to more accurate, robust and potentially safer executed trajectories.</p>

      <p>
      As the development of various technologies make our societies flourish, it is a natural implication that the variance of ideas, opinions, and criticisms proliferate too. As a consequence, we will become witnesses to more and more extreme events in all areas of life. The speed with which information travels is so fast that public opinion can change rapidly leading to furious debates on policies or even divided societies. In this volatile context adversaries are incentivized to lead information warfare, while leaders face the problem of uniting the citizens. Technologies like artificial intelligence will <em>most likely</em> lead to the end of humanism, even though few people realize this. Moreover, in a world where it becomes easier and easier to attain basic sustenance, the big question of finding meaning on an individual level steadily starts knocking at the door. We will have to question things which we have been taking for granted. We will have to rethink and adapt.

      <p>
      The so-called "hard" problem of consciousness is one of the "hardest" conceptual questions related to our cognition and self-understanding. This problem has pervaded cultures and generations. Even modern neuroscientific theories of consciousness seem to fall short of being able to tackle it. In this post I delineate my take on the subject by answering those questions which are meaningful and explaining why other questions are ill-posed. In general, consciousness can be understood as a computational paradigm, and this is the only point of view which matters.

      <p>
      Consciousness has been a long-debated concept related to the nature of human cognition and self-understanding. As AI systems become more capable and autonomous, it is an increasingly pressing matter whether they can be called conscious. Here I present a criterion for verifying whether a machine learning agent can be considered conscious, in a similar way as to how a human is believed to be conscious. Based on linguistic experiments with GPT-4, a large language model with unprecedented language capabilities, one may claim that autoregressive LLM engines can serve as sufficiently powerful simulacra for humanlike consciousness. Additionally, it is fairly easy to build reinforcement learning agents that satisfy by construction the functional requirements of consciousness. Task performance still ultimately depends on the modeling capabilities of the agent where intelligence, understood simply as the ability to model complicated relationships, is what matters.

      <p>
      Robert Nozick is one of the most influential right-libertarian philosphers. In his book "Anarchy, State, and Utopia", he defends the idea of a minimal state, arguing that a larger state violates individuals' rights. He believes that the only legitimate functions of a state are to protect individuals from force, theft, and fraud, and to enforce contracts. This representation of a minimal state is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night-watchman_state">Night-Watchman state</a> - a state where the government is only concerned with the provision of military defense, police, and courts. Nozick's ideas are influential and well-regarded, if not always agreed with. This post explores some of them.

      Like virtually all aspects of our daily lives, there are many patterns hidden in our behaviour. Very few of our habits and activities are truly random. Hence, if we collect almost any data, we'll most certainly find useful patterns and regularities in it. The world which we have constructed is <strong>very</strong> regular and this has facilitated fields like data science to spread out and grow across all domains like mushrooms after rain.

      <p>Let's take a look at the IS-LM-PC model again. There will be some overlap with the <a href="https://aceofgreens.github.io/a_tour_de_force_of_the_economy.html">previous article</a>, but the emphasis here will be slightly different.</p>
<p>Aggregate output <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> depends on the firms producing goods. In a closed economy, total output equal total income. The production function depends on capital <span class="math">\(K\)</span> and labour <span class="math">\(L\)</span>, which are called the <em>factors of production</em>, and their costs are the rental price <span class="math">\(R\)</span> and wages <span class="math">\(W\)</span>. Total output is determined by production. </p>
<p><strong>Production</strong>. If firms are price-takers in both the inputs and output markets, as in perfect competition, then the price <span class="math">\(P\)</span>, wages <span class="math">\(W\)</span> and rental costs <span class="math">\(R\)</span> are exogeneous. Firms maximize profit <span class="math">\(\pi = PF(K, L) - RK - WL\)</span> and a first-order condition for selecting the right quantity of <span class="math">\((K, L)\)</span> is given by <span class="math">\(\frac{\partial F}{\partial K} = R/P\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\frac{\partial F}{\partial L} = W/P\)</span>. Thus, it is optimal for firms to increase <span class="math">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math">\(L\)</span> until their marginal products become equal to the real costs of the factors of production - the real wage <span class="math">\(W/P\)</span> and the real cost of capital <span class="math">\(R/P\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Economic profits</strong>. Firm profits at that quantity equal <span class="math">\(\pi = Y - F_K'K - F_L' L\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(F_K'\)</span> and <span class="math">\(F_L'\)</span> are the corresponding derivatives. If we assume that the production function <span class="math">\(F\)</span> has constant returns to scale, so that <span class="math">\(zY = F(zK, zL)\)</span>, and take the derivative with respect to <span class="math">\(z\)</span> we get <span class="math">\(Y = zF_K' K + zF_L' L\)</span>. Setting <span class="math">\(z=1\)</span> we get the exact expression for the profits <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span>. Thus, under perfect competition and constant returns to scale we can say that total income gets fully spent and divided between the factors of production, according to their productivities. There is no economic profit. An additional worker is employed only if his incremental contribution to profit is greater than his real wage.</p>
<p><strong>Demand for goods and services</strong>. The total demand for goods and services <span class="math">\(Z\)</span> comes from households, which consume (and save), firms, which invest (and produce), and governments which fund public projects (and tax), <span class="math">\(Z = C + I + G\)</span>. In an open economy the net trade balance also affects demand, but we'll assume a closed economy for now. Households spend a fraction of their disposable income <span class="math">\(Y - T\)</span>, with <span class="math">\(T\)</span> being the taxes, in the goods and services markets. Whatever is not spent, is saved. These savings are deposited in banks or used to buy bonds, stocks, or mutual funds. In other words, savings enter the financial markets. Firms on the other hand invest in capital goods to increase their productive capacity. These purchases are funded by bank loans, or by issuing bonds and shares. Thus, a <em>market for loanable funds</em> is formed where households are the suppliers and firms are the consumers. Capital accumulation is an intertemporal affair and the price in the market of loanable funds is the interest rate. Thus, demand for inverstment depends negatively on the real interest rate <span class="math">\(r\)</span>, <span class="math">\(I(r)\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Classical view equilibrium</strong>. At equilibrium the supply for goods and services equals the demand for such. If the production factors <span class="math">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math">\(L\)</span> are fixed, then also total output <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> is fixed. Government spending <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is also usually assumed exogeneous and fixed. Hence, if there is a shock increase to, say, consumption, the only thing that can change is the real interest rate <span class="math">\(r\)</span> in the financial markets. Hence the relationships:</p>
<ol>
<li>An increase in consumption raises the interest rate as there are less loanable funds overall</li>
<li>An increase in government spending reduces equilibrium investment and increases the interest rate.</li>
<li>An increase in investment demand raises the interest rate and increases investment only if this induces additional saving.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Investment-Saving</strong>. Note that at equilibrium, when <span class="math">\(Y = C + I + G\)</span>, one can rearrange the variables so that total spending, given by the sum of private spending <span class="math">\(Y - T - C\)</span> and public spending <span class="math">\(T - G\)</span> is equal to investment <span class="math">\(I\)</span>, i.e <span class="math">\((Y - T -C) + (T - G) = I\)</span>. This is the same way to look at the equilibrium - households' desire to save balances out firms' desire to invest.</p>
<!-- with $C = C(Y-T)$ being consumption which depends positively on disposable income $Y-T$  -->

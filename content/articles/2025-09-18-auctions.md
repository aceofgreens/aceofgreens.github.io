The most basic auction has an intuitive design. There is a single item to be sold and each strategic bidder $i$ has a *private* nonnegative valuation $v_i$ of that item, representing his maximum willingness-to-pay (WTP). The bidder wants to acquire the item as cheaply as possible, and his utility is quasilinear: zero if he doesn't acquire it and $v_i - p$ if he does acquire it for a price $p$. A *sealed-bid* auction proceeds as follows: i) all bidders submit their bids privately to the seller, ii) the seller decides who gets the item (if anyone), and iii) the seller decides on a selling price. For the second step, the obvious case is when the seller gives the item to the highest bidder. However, for the third steps, there are different options, with different implications.

**First price auctions**. In a first price auction the highest bidder pays their own bid for the item. From the perspective of bidder $i$, he will get the item if he bids more than the highest other bid, suppose $p_j$, but his utility would only decrease if he bids too high. Hence, his optimal bid has to be just above that of the next highest bidder, $p_i = \text{min}(v_i, p_j + \epsilon)$. This is inconvenient because it requires knowing $p_j$ which is private... Therefore bidding strategies in first price auctions tend to be very hard to reason about.

**Second price auctions**. Consider what happens if the highest bidder does not pay his own bid, but the next highest, effectively the second-highest bid. What incentives does this little change create? To get the item, bidder $i$ needs $p_i > p_j$. But he should not always try to get the item at any cost.

- The only situation in which he has negative utility is when $p_i > p_j > v_i$, i.e. he gets the item $p_i > p_j$, but pays $p_j > v_i$ more than its worth to him. From this we see that $p_i$ should never be above $v_i$. 
- Similarly, the only situation in which he loses out on positive utility is when $v_i > p_j > p_i$. From this we see that to avoid lost opportunities $p_i$ should never be below $v_i$. 
- Cases where $p_j > p_i$ and $p_j > v_i$ don't matter because bidder $i$ doesn't get the item and doesn't care enough to get it.

As a result, we have that $p_i = v_i$, that is, the bidder should always bid exactly equal to his private valuation. If his valuation is the highest, he'll get the item, otherwise he won't, which is fair. Notice how this bidding strategy is particularly simple because it's independent of what the other players bid. In that sense, bidding $p_i = v_i$ is a dominant strategy, because it's always the best.

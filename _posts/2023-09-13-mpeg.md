I find the topics of image analysis and video compression very enjoyable. A previous [post](https://aceofgreens.github.io/steganography_and_jpeg.html) has covered JPEG, the most widely used image compression standard. Now it's time to explore the [MPEG standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_Picture_Experts_Group#Standards), at least some of them. This is a super important topic, as videos are too large to store or stream across the internet in their raw format. So we necessarily need efficient compression algorithms. And there is some solid math, like the DCT, as well as various engineering tricks, like quantization and predictive coding, involved in them...

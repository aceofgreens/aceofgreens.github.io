      <p>
      From the previous article on <a href="https://aceofgreens.github.io/free_banking.html">free banking</a>, we saw how a competitive market for loans and deposits will result in virtually no inflation and a fixed money supply. In this post we'll enter the belly of the beast and see how central banking is designed to eliminate the constaints that keep inflation in check. This is a very important topic for understanding financial systems and once again, almighty Rothbard will guide us.

      <p>
      <a href="https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/cogsci-2024/">CogSci2024</a> was a blast. Lots of interesting talks and posters. It was particularly nice to see how the cogsci community approaches certain questions differently from the ML people and yes, it's <em>quite</em> different, even the methodology seems to be different. From what I saw cogsci people tend to engage more in the classic scientific method - hypothesis creation, implementation, and experiments, conlusions. With ML, deep learning specifically, it's more of an engineering approach, where the emphasis is on practical results and proper benchmarking. This is what we'll discuss here. All in all, the conference was great. I presented some ideas, made new friends, learned some things, disagreed on others, explored Rotterdam (the host city) and left excited and with new ideas.

      <p>
      In this post we explore Llama-3, a popular LLM. Because of its open-source nature and its compact architecture, it serves as a great example for studying how LLMs work and what are the main research directions around optimizing their use-cases. We focus mainly on the architecture as it literally affects all other aspects of the model - how it is used, how it is optimized, and how it can be modified.

      I've previously mentioned the curiosity itch, which prompts you to explore new ideas and try out new things. Turns out, this curiosity can be very much manifested in the desire to explore other countries and to seek reasonable adrenaline-filled activities beyond the mundane day-to-day. I've had quite a few amazing journeys already, and this post is about one recent road trip from Denmark to Spain which was full of exciting stuff.

      <p>
      JAX, the functional automatic differentiation library from Google, has established itself as a highly useful deep learning tool. It stands in stark contrast with the OOP approach of Torch and offers an interesting perspective to how deep learning systems can be built in an entirely functional approach. In reality, the boundaries between Torch and Jax are blurry, as nowadays <code>flax</code> has features which look like the OOP style of Torch, while <code>functorch</code> mimics the features of Jax. Nonetheless, Jax was the first of its kind and still carries heavy momentum when it comes to new projects implemented with it. Let's explore it a bit.

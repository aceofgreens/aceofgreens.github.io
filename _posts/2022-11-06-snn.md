Traditional artificial neural networks have attained incredible, even at times super-human, performance on specific well-defined tasks like object detection, recognition, and sequential decision-making. But whether the neurons in our human brains work the same way is questionable. It is generally believed that our neural architectures are not feed-forward, but contain many more loops, with many feedback effects on all levels. Additionally, biological neurons have the temporal dimension naturally built into their workings, whereas the perceptron has no notion of time and cannot distinguish between different orderings of the same sequence of inputs. This post explores spiking neural networks, which address the above concerns and seem to more closely mimic the neurons in the real world.

To derive the behaviour of a neuron we can construct an electric circuit from the observed neuron's morphology and solve that circuit. Figure 1 shows a simplified [neuron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neuron) with which we can compare.

The neuron is a cell specialized in the transmission of electric pulses. It has a cell body, called *soma*, which contains the nucleus where most protein synthesis processes occur. There are also multiple *dendrites* - extensions of the neuron which bring in signals from the other neurons into the body, and an *axon* which takes information away from the body. The dendrites are covered with *synapses* which are the specific contact points where the transfer of signals, i.e. electric pulses, between neurons occurs.

To make an analogy (that may sacrifice correctness in favour of simplicity) with artificial neurons, we can think of it as follows. The dendrites determine how many inputs there are. The synapses represent the actual learnable weights $w_i$. The sign and magnitude of the weights represents the excitatory or inhibitory effect they have on the output. The role of the soma is to aggregate the inputs $x_1, ..., x_N$ by summing up all the modulated signals - outputs from other neurons times weights - and the axon, along with the signal travelling in it $y$, represent the output. The non-linearity function $\sigma$ does not fit particularly well in this picture but we can agree its nature is less biologically-inspired and more of a practical necessity. This forms the standard formula for the perceptron

$$
y = \sigma \Big (\sum_{i = 1}^N w_i x_i \Big).
$$

To improve over this model we can take a closer look at another component - the *membrane* surrounding the soma. It is a bilayer of lipid molecules that separates the solutions within and outside of the neuron body. In particular, the membrane acts as a insulator between the two conductive solutions and can thus be modelled as a capacitor. The resulting voltage is measured between the inside and the outside of the membrane. Moreover, the membrane also has ion channels which are pathways that allow various ions (of sodium, chloride, etc.) to flow through it. These are voltage-gated and can be opened or closed depending on the voltage difference across the membrane. As a result, we can model these ion channels as resistors in a circuit.

</figure> 

With our circuit defined, we can solve it. The input current splits across the capacitor and the resistor $I(t) = I_R(t) + I_C(t)$. For a capacitor, the total charge $Q(t)$ is equal to the product of the capacitance $C$ and the current voltage $U(t)$, $Q(t) = C U(t) $. The total charge changes as $\frac{d Q(t)}{d t} = C \frac{d U(t)}{dt} = I_C(t)$. For the resistor, Ohm's law states that if $U(t)$ is the voltage between two points and $R$ is the resistance, then the current is $U(t)/R$ Coulombs per second. Hence,

$$
I(t) = \frac{U(t)}{R} + C \frac{dU(t)}{dt} \Rightarrow \frac{dU(t)}{dt} = \frac{1}{RC} \big(- U(t) + I(t) R \big).
$$

Solving this yields

$$
U(t) = I(t) R + \big(U(0) - I(t) R \big ) e^ {-t/(RC)}.
$$

This is a very useful controller. The equation above shows that the membrane potential $U(t)$ depends on the input current $I(t)$. If we supply the neuron membrane with a constant current, then the potential $U(t)$ will change exponentially fast towards the value $I(t) R$ and will stabilize, because $I(t)$ is constant. If on the other hand, $I(t)$ is rapidly changing, then $U(t)$ will also change rapidly, trying to catch up to $I(t)R$. If $I(t)$ is zero, $U(t)$ will tend to 0. If $I(t)$ is oscillating, $U(t)$ will also oscillate. And if $I(t)$ is a pulse input, then $U(t)$ will spike up initially and then quickly decay towards 0.

If the input current is spiky, with only periodically being different from zero, and for very short amounts of time, then the membrane potential also starts to look spiky through time. In an infinitesimally short period $dt$ during which $I(t)$ is non-zero, the rise in $U(t)$ is almost infinitesimally steep, owing to the rapid change in $I(t)$, after which it starts to decay gradually.

So far, the neuron has an adaptive membrane potential but no real output. It is common to model the output as a binary spike which is toggled if the membrane potential reaches a predefined threshold. Additionally, it has been observed that neurons do not fire constantly if their resting potential $I(t) R$ is above the threshold. This requires adding a cooldown period, or a reset mechanism, which decrements the membrane potential before the neuron can fire again. This is called [hyperpolarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperpolarization_(biology)).

Thus, let the membrane potential threshold be $\bar{U}$ and the spike variable be $S(t)$ where

$$
S(t) = \begin{cases}
    1, \text{ if } U(t) > \bar{U} \\
    0, \text{ otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
$$

To illustrate the whole idea we discretize the differential equation above and implement the spikes and the reset mechanism:

$$
U(t+\Delta t) = U(t) + \frac{\Delta t}{RC} \big (I(t) R - U(t) \big) - S(t) \bar{U}
$$

The reset mechanism instantly decrements the current potential by the spiking threshold if a spike has occurred. This is one way to model it and it's also possible to directly set the potential to zero. The combination of the simple RC-circuit, the spikes threshold and the reset mechanism is called the leaky-integrate-and-fire model. It was proposed by [Louis Lapicque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Lapicque) back in 1907. Since then, there have been other models like the adaptive integrate-and-fire where the frequency of spikes decreases even with constant input current, and the Hodgkinâ€“Huxley model which has additional components.

      <p>
      In this post we explore Llama-3, a popular LLM. Because of its open-source nature and its compact architecture, it serves as a great example for studying how LLMs work and what are the main research directions around optimizing their use-cases. We focus mainly on the architecture as it literally affects all other aspects of the model - how it is used, how it is optimized, and how it can be modified.

      <p>
      JAX, the functional automatic differentiation library from Google, has established itself as a highly useful deep learning tool. It stands in stark contrast with the OOP approach of Torch and offers an interesting perspective to how deep learning systems can be built in an entirely functional approach. In reality, the boundaries between Torch and Jax are blurry, as nowadays <code>flax</code> has features which look like the OOP style of Torch, while <code>functorch</code> mimics the features of Jax. Nonetheless, Jax was the first of its kind and still carries heavy momentum when it comes to new projects implemented with it. Let's explore it a bit.

      <p>
      Diffusion models have take the world by storm. They have proved able to learn complicated distributions with impressive accuracy, enough to have real-world general-purpose utility. Their widespread use in text-to-image models is now evident and, interestingly, is spreading to many other problem settings. I have purposefully waited quite some time for the hype to settle down. But now, when expectations are more realistic, it's time to explore these curious models and the real impact they have on the current state of deep learning.

      <p>
      As the scale of my ML projects started to increase, I have found myself in need of understanding more and more the actual engineering aspects around the models. I am perfectly fine with deep learning being an engineering-first discipline, rather than a theory-first one. Yet there are considerably more high-quality sources about the algorithms than about the implementation tricks needed. This post attempts to summarize important knowledge useful in understanding how to scale the modern deep learning approach to larger datasets, more nodes, and across different accelerators. Most likely, this is the first of multiple such posts.

      <p>
      Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as the cornerstone behind the surge of large-scale models permeating the mainstream. In this post, we'll delve into the main families of SSL algorithms, primarily with a focus on those in the realm of computer vision.

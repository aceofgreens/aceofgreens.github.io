      <p>
      Here we take a look at some basic use-cases with DINOv2, Clip, and Google's new visual-language model PaliGemma 2. This is not meant to be a comprehensive overview of vision-language models. We will only dip our toes into this vast topic, which is only becoming more and more prominent in current AI. All these models can be considered <em>foundational</em>.

      <p>
      Current methods to learn controllers for autonomous vehicles (AVs) focus on behavioural cloning, where agents learn to mimic the actions obtained from an expert trajectory. Being trained only on exact historic data, the resulting agents often generalize poorly when deployed to novel scenarios. Simulators provide the opportunity to go beyond offline datasets, but they are still treated as complicated black boxes, only used to update the global simulation state. As a result, these RL algorithms are slow, sample-inefficient, and prior-agnostic. Instead, if these simulators are differentiable, they can be included into an end-to-end training loop, turning their hard-coded world dynamics into useful inductive biases for the model. Here we explore the differentiable Waymax simulator and use analytic policy gradients to train AV controllers on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) [1]. This allows us to learn robust, accurate, and fast policies only using gradient descent.

      <p>
      I've decided to better understand the Keynesian and classical macroeconomic views. This post covers both approaches in the short and long run. There will be some overlap with the <a href="https://aceofgreens.github.io/a_tour_de_force_of_the_economy.html">previous article</a>, but the emphasis here will be slightly different. Note that what we call here long run is actually the medium run in that post. The very long run, when output is determined by technological progress and capital, will not be considered here.

      <p>
      Spherical harmonics are a nice little mathematical tool that has found big applications in computer vision for modeling view-dependent light. The first time I encountered them was in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05131">Plenoxels</a> paper and I've been meaning to explore them ever since. Apart from the mathematics, there's not much to worry about, it's actually quite pleasant.

      These are some brief notes from ECCV and IROS, two of the biggest AI conferences, held in early and mid October 2024, in less than 2 weeks apart. I attended both, which was very satisfying and tiring. This pose summarizes some findings and impressions.

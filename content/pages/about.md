<p>The Critical Section is a blog where I intend to periodically post ideas and insights which I consider interesting, thought-provoking and useful to know.</p>

To get a feeling for what Iâ€™m all about, check out some of my favourite quotes:
<ul>

<li><em>Knowledge of some principles easily compensates the lack of knowledge of some facts.</em><br>
- Claude Helvetius</li>

<li><em>What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence.</em><br> - Christopher Hitchens</li>

<li><em>I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.</em><br> - Isaac Newton</li>

<!-- <li><em>In the great chess-board of human society, every single piece has a principle of motion of its own, altogether different from that which the legislature might choose to impress upon it.</em><br> - Adam Smith </li> -->

</ul>

My interests lie in fields like machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer science, economics.

This blog is dedicated to *The Electric Messiah* and *The Fellowship*. They have provided me with precious bits of high-quality training signal and have supported, encouraged, and shaped my worldview more than anyone else, for which I am beyond grateful.

      <p>
      Consciousness has been a long-debated concept related to the nature of human cognition and self-understanding. As AI systems become more capable and autonomous, it is an increasingly pressing matter whether they can be called conscious. Here I present a criterion for verifying whether a machine learning agent can be considered conscious, in a similar way as to how a human is believed to be conscious. Based on linguistic experiments with GPT-4, a large language model with unprecedented language capabilities, one may claim that autoregressive LLM engines can serve as sufficiently powerful simulacra for humanlike consciousness. Additionally, it is fairly easy to build reinforcement learning agents that satisfy by construction the functional requirements of consciousness. Task performance still ultimately depends on the modeling capabilities of the agent where intelligence, understood simply as the ability to model complicated relationships, is what matters.

      Previously, I've <a href="https://aceofgreens.github.io/2022/05/19/why_do_beetles_love_life.html">tried to convince you</a> that the utter desire to live at any cost is not something fundamental or designed with any global purpose. It is a purely random quality which has serendipitously proved useful in increasing our fitness in the environment. As a result those who have the will to live survive, and the others do not. There was a time when the probability of life suceeding has been marginal, but luckily this time is long gone. The qualities that aid life have become stable and ubiquitous, and life flourishes. Given that, we still don't know how exactly it is that humans give meaning to their existence. Are there any observable patterns that can shine a light on this conundrum? Can we solve the plight of how we attribute meaning?

      Coming up with a functional model of consciousness has been, and still is, a very hard and elusive task. The difficult part is dealing with the "hard problem of consciousness" which is about explaining the existence of <em>qualia</em> - e.g. the experience of hearing the birds chirping, the feeling of joy, the association between a beautiful sunny day and pleasure. To me it is obvious that, in order to seriously tackle the problem of understanding how human experience works, we need to come up with proper technical terms and ideas that describe these phenomena in an objective manner. This would trivialize the concept of human experience but I feel that it's a necessary step. Ultimately, as soon as you break down the jigsaw puzzle into its smallest parts, it loses its magical wonder at the expense of a huge increase in our understanding. We are trivialization machines.

      I recently attended the <a href="https://2022.imol-conf.org/">Fifth International Workshop on Intrinsically Motivated Open-ended Learning</a> (IMOL 2022) in TÃ¼bingen, Germany. It was a very nice event, with interesting presentations and discussions all around. This post aims to summarize the highlights and provide some thoughts on the content discussed therein.

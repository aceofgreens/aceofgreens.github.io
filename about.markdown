<p>The Critical Section is a blog where I intend to periodically post ideas and insights which I consider interesting, thought-provoking and useful to know.</p>

To get a feeling for what I'm all about, check out some of my favourite quotes:
<ul>

<li><em>Knowledge of some principles easily compensates the lack of knowledge of some facts.</em><br>
- Claude Helvetius</li>

<li><em>What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence.</em><br> - Christopher Hitchens</li>

<li><em>I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.</em><br> - Isaac Newton</li>

</ul>

My interests lie in fields like machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer science, economics.

Artificial general intelligence (AGI) still seems to be elusive. Although we are getting close to building a first [generalist RL agent](https://www.deepmind.com/publications/a-generalist-agent), it is unclear what exactly distinguishes, if at all, an AGI agent from a non-AGI one, trained on many different tasks, and able to generalize across them. Turns out, the kind of mathematical formalism that we need is already here. This post examines these beautiful, intuitive ideas and discusses what it takes to build an agent capable of coming up with the optimal-*est* optimal decisions.

      <a class="enum_title" href="private_law_and_defense.html"><b>Private Legislation and Defense</b></a>
      
      <p>
      Legislation and military defense have long been described as hallmark purposes for the state's existence. Yet we know that a free market usually produces goods and services more efficiently than any entity not constrained by the competitive pressure. So can't the free market also produce legislation and defense? Famous economists from the Austrian school claim this is possible. In this post we'll explore the main theoretical arguments in favour of this scheme.

      <p>
      The financial system is a very complicated ensemble of regulation, banking practices, and inter-dependent agents striving to achieve their own goals. Presently, the situation in money markets is notably distinct from that in other markets as the existence of a central bank on the one hand does smooth out market shocks, but on the other creates a bright-as-day monopoly on the supply of money. In this post we explore an alternative - that of free banking - the state of affairs where banks are unregulated, utterly free to enter and exit the market, and have to comply only with the capricious demands of clients, not regulators. Nowadays, free banking is largely ignored due to how conspicuously different it is compared to the central bank model. Yet, there are precious insights to be learned from it.

      <p>
      Robert Nozick is one of the most influential right-libertarian philosphers. In his book "Anarchy, State, and Utopia", he defends the idea of a minimal state, arguing that a larger state violates individuals' rights. He believes that the only legitimate functions of a state are to protect individuals from force, theft, and fraud, and to enforce contracts. This representation of a minimal state is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night-watchman_state">Night-Watchman state</a> - a state where the government is only concerned with the provision of military defense, police, and courts. Nozick's ideas are influential and well-regarded, if not always agreed with. This post explores some of them.

      <p>
      Like virtually all aspects of our daily lives, there are many patterns hidden in our behaviour. Very few of our habits and activities are truly random. Hence, if we collect almost any data, we'll most certainly find useful patterns and regularities in it. The world which we have constructed is <strong>very</strong> regular and this has facilitated fields like data science to spread out and grow across all domains like mushrooms after rain.

      <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_voting">Weighted voting</a>, the idea that some participants have bigger weight to their vote than others, is a controversial but important idea. While it can illuminate many of our modern world practices and suggest novel ways to look at them, it still seems under-developed in the literature, at least in those aspects which I'll discuss here. This topic is near and dear to me and I have spent the last four years thinking about it. I have discussed it with friends and acquaintances, finding that few share my enthusiasm on it. Nonetheless, time and logic have fully convinced me of its merit... Buckle up, this is going to be a ride.

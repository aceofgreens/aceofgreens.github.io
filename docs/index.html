      <p>
      LLM agents are systems where a LLM is integrated with other components that allow it to better plan or act in a more autonomous manner. Recently, the term <em>agentic design patterns</em> has been used to describe the particular solutions that go in this direction. Given that LLMs have now been used for all kinds of things - solvers, planners, schedulers - the question of how to extend them to real-world tasks requiring more autonomy is ever more pertinent.

      <p>
      World models are still a central topic in RL, even after 30 years since their inception. But they're also growing in popularity, even outside of RL. Nowadays interest is fueled by video models like OpenAI's <a href="https://openai.com/index/sora/">Sora</a>, Luma's <a href="https://lumalabs.ai/dream-machine">DreamMachine</a>, Google's <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/">Veo</a>, or Runway's <a href="https://runwayml.com/research/introducing-gen-3-alpha">Gen-3-Alpha</a>. The idea here is that to be able to generate accurate physics, occlusions, deformations, or interactions, you need to have proper knowledge of how the real world works. This post will trace the development of world models from the last ten or so years up to today, focusing on key ideas and developments.

      <p>
      From the previous article on <a href="https://aceofgreens.github.io/free_banking.html">free banking</a>, we saw how a competitive market for loans and deposits will result in virtually no inflation and a fixed money supply. In this post we'll enter the belly of the beast and see how central banking is designed to eliminate the constraints that keep inflation in check. This is a very important topic for understanding financial systems and once again, almighty Rothbard will guide us.

      <p>
      <a href="https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/cogsci-2024/">CogSci2024</a> was a blast. Lots of interesting talks and posters. It was particularly nice to see how the cogsci community approaches certain questions differently from the ML people and yes, it's <em>quite</em> different, even the methodology seems to be different. From what I saw cogsci people tend to engage more in the classic scientific method - hypothesis creation, implementation, and experiments, conlusions. With ML, deep learning specifically, it's more of an engineering approach, where the emphasis is on practical results and proper benchmarking. This is what we'll discuss here. All in all, the conference was great. I presented some ideas, made new friends, learned some things, disagreed on others, explored Rotterdam (the host city) and left excited and with new ideas.

      <p>
      In this post we explore Llama-3, a popular LLM. Because of its open-source nature and its compact architecture, it serves as a great example for studying how LLMs work and what are the main research directions around optimizing their use-cases. We focus mainly on the architecture as it literally affects all other aspects of the model - how it is used, how it is optimized, and how it can be modified.

Previously, I've [tried to convince you](https://aceofgreens.github.io/2022/05/19/why_do_beetles_love_life.html) that the utter desire to live at any cost is not something fundamental or designed with any global purpose. It is a purely random quality which has serendipitously proved useful in increasing our fitness in the environment. As a result those who have the will to live survive, and the others do not. There was a time when the probability of life suceeding has been marginal, but luckily this time is long gone. The qualities that aid life have become stable and ubiquitous, and life flourishes. Given that, we still don't know how exactly it is that humans give meaning to their existence. Are there any observable patterns that can shine a light on this conundrum? Can we solve the plight of how we attribute meaning?


<!-- Main ideas: 
meaning as an isomorphism
psychosomatic rewards
Control through sensors
Association between higher order states of the world
